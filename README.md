# esx_vehicletrunk
alpha version - use at your own risk  
You can remove the debug marker by commenting out the drawmarker function  
Features:  
1. Hopefully only one player can access one trunk at a time
2. Some sort of a item limit?
3. Players can spawn weapon ammo(gives the config.default amount on item pull) until I have time to make this count ammo.
4. Only one JSON entry per vehicle
5. Entries for stolen vehicles are removed each restart
6. Players can't search locked vehicles
